1. so in frontend we have to create 4 routes for the users
- /user/register => user register form
- /user/login => user login form

- /food-partner/register => food-partner register form 
- /food-partner/login => food-partner login form

2.use gpt for making ui
3.use -npm i axios for api integration (linking frontend to api)
4.To add new features
-you have to  modify the schemas , and the jsx logic that is above the return function in a particular function
-also modify the router/apis basically controller auth.controller
